## **üìÉ Explanation**
This project was created to study and analyse biomedical images with DICOM extensions, like this:

<img alt="example" src="./data/example.png">

**DICOM** is an acronym for *Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine*. Files in this format are most likely saved with either a DCM or DCM30 (DICOM 3.0) file extension.

The objective is to load the data images of a human chest, use necessary filters and understand how to see possible problems.

## Steps
1. **Introduction**: Import the necessary libraries to read every DICOM medical image.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Load, construct and navigate in N-dimensional images using CT scans of human chests.
3. **Usage of masks and filters in biomedical images**: Use grayscales to facilitate the processing.
4. **Biomedical images measures and comparision**
5. **Conclusion**

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used**

The following technologies were used:

  - Python
- Libraries:
  ```python
  # Main library to resolve the problem.
  import imageio as iio
  # Library to help in images visualization.
